Jetty Extras
------------

### Serving Resources from a relative path

Sometimes you may want to serve resources from a relative path, for example a sibling directory located at `../client`. But paths containing `..` are considered aliased and Jetty disallows these by default,
as described in this [policy](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/serving-aliased-files.html).

If you've evaluated the security risks described in the link above and wish to enable aliases in paths, you can do so 
with `allowAliases(true)`, eg:

```scala
unfiltered.jetty.Server.http(8080).
      context("/client"){ ctx: ContextAdder =>
      ctx.resources(new java.net.URL(
        """file:../client"""
      )).allowAliases(true)
      }.plan(myPlan).run()
```

### Enabling Request Logs

Jetty can be configured to log all requests in Common or Extended formats with `requestLogging`. This is a global, not per-context, 
[setting](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-jetty-request-logs.html). 
At minimum you need to specify where to log to:

```scala
unfiltered.jetty.Server.http(8080).plan(myPlan).requestLogging("/tmp/access.log").run()
```
